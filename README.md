# SQL Employee Data
Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) has just hired you and the first project you are asked to do is get info on people who worked at the company during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files (inluded in the data folder).

For this project, youâ€™ll first create an ERD (layout) of how the tables are connected using primary and foreign keys.

(insert ERD image)

Then, you'll import the CSV files into a SQL database and answer questions posed by Pewlett Hackard leadership by querying the data.

# Getting Started
The program used to create the ERD was QuickDBD
The analysis was done using postgres and Jupyter Notebook
